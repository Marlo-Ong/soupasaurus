## Summary

Soupasaurus is a brand new type of personality test powered by AI. Instead of taking the same boring and lengthy personality test every time you forget your [MBTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator), go on an adventure and converse with a cast of eccentric prehistoric characters - each with their own unique dinosaur personalities and quirks - to find out once and for all what soup you really are. Have new and fresh conversations on each playthrough thanks to Google's Gemini LLM!
